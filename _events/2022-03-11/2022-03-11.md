- Want to know why some populations are associated with a higher risk of occupational injury?
- Does living in a polluted environment make one more prone to diseases?
- What can we do to improve the environment?
- 想知道為什麼老天不公平，明明都是做同一種類型的工作，有些族群就是比較容易得到職業傷害？
- 想知道長期居住在空汙嚴重的地區，是否真的比較容易生病？而當空污嚴重又不想宅在家的時候，該去何處吸到好空氣？
- 讓我們一起了解最新的公衛研究與先進的地理資訊遙測科技，是如何促進大眾的健康福祉。
