是否好奇為什麼治療同一種疾病的藥物，有些很便宜，有些卻特別貴呢？這個星期六(2/11)下午，BTBA邀請到目前在Costello Medical 擔任健康經濟學家(health economist)的Blake Liu來為大家分享HEOR (Health Economics and Outcomes Research)的現況，以及各國的藥價是怎麼制定的。

在人生的旅途上，除了保持健康外，找到人生的方向也是許多人耕耘的目標，若有幸遇到貴人指點，這趟旅程將會增色不少。這個星期六(2/11)下午，BTBA也邀請到從教職轉任life coach的張碧環學姊，以及有多年mentoring經驗的Bing-Shiou Yang大哥，來分享如何找到人生的方向與經營一段mentor-mentee的關係。
