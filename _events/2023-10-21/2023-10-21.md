Afterward, our executive team will lead interactive networking sessions, facilitating attendees to make new friends and get to know each other better!

Lunch and refreshments will be provided. Tickets are available at $15 for adults, $10 for students, and free for children under 12 years old. Admission is free for the 2023 BTBA Committee members.
