《RNA剪切引起的發炎反應疾病》<br>
《同場加映：RNA小分子藥物開發》<br>
這個星期五晚上，RNA專家們將帶您探索RNA，並解說如何針對RNA治療疾病！

This Friday evening, we're excited to bring in two RNA experts, Dr. Liang-Yuan Chiu & Dr. Frank Fang-Yao Lee, to share how scientists develop RNA-targeted small molecules and how alternative splicing contributes to the development of inflammatory disorders.
RNA-targeted small molecules have emerged as a potential avenue for drug discovery, offering unique advantages over traditional protein-targeted approaches. These molecules can modulate gene expression by targeting various types of RNA, including viral RNA, messenger RNA, non-coding RNA, and ribosomal RNA. The upcoming seminar will explore the potential benefits and obstacles of the RNA-targeted small molecule modality. Additionally, we will discuss utilizing structural insights to design innovative small molecule inhibitors that focus on RNA-targeted small molecules to combat hand, foot, and mouth disease.

RNA splicing is a fascinating molecular mechanism critical in disease development. For example, alternative splicing contributes to the development of inflammatory disorders like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This Friday evening, we'll explore the promising future of using these RNA mechanisms as innovative therapeutic approaches to combat these diseases.
