- 你是否好奇如何利用CRISPR的尖端技術，破解藏在蛋白質體裡的黑暗物質？
- 想了解如何透過研究他人的研究，讓科學的新發現更站得住腳嗎？
- 讓我們一起探索，如何針對小至基因、大至研究數據本身，為科學研究帶來突破性的進展！
- Want to learn about the newest developments in CRISPR technologies?
- How can genomic tools and CRISPR screens be used to discover novel proteins?
- How does meta-research strengthen the reliability of existing evidence?
- What are the current challenges in statistical methods for meta-research?

- Speaker:
    - Jin Chen 陳沛均, PhD. Former Graduate Coop & Internship Coordinator, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Northeastern University
        - In 2015, Jin received his Ph.D. from Stanford University, where he worked in the lab of Jody Puglisi working developing single-molecule fluorescence techniques to monitor real-time ribosome translation. Afterwards, he joined the lab of Jonathan Weissman at UCSF, where he developed various sequencing and CRISPR-based screens to dissect the protein-coding capacity of the human genome, uncovering pervasive non-canonical translation and a whole universe of novel, unannotated proteins. His postdoc was funded by a Jane Coffin Childs postdoc fellowship and a NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award. In October of 2020, he joined the faculty at UT Southwestern as an Endowed Scholar and CPRIT Scholar, where his lab will further study the regulatory roles of non-canonical translation and the unannotated proteome in health and disease.
