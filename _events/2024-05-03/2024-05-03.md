🧐🧐🧐你知道臺灣對新冠肺炎的防疫超前部署有部分歸功於PTT的「護國神文」嗎？

🤧時間倒轉回2019年，一位疾管署防疫醫師在網路論壇PTT上發現了一篇文章正在沸沸揚揚的討論武漢市因發生不明原因肺炎而引發群聚感染，並於第一時間通報衛福部，也為疫情防疫揭開了序幕。四年後的今天世界逐漸進入後疫情時代，除了相關快篩、疫苗和藥物的迅速開發外，病原篩檢偵測技術的研發也在短時間內突飛猛進，從四年前PTT上的無心插柳到今日各國積極投入研發病原防禦網盼能有效地提早控制和預防疫情傳播。

🦠BTBA很榮幸可以邀請到Ginkgo Bioworks的Senior Director Robert Morfino及許書瑀博士來揭開Biosecurity‒疫情當前情報網的神秘面紗。過去幾年，他們藉由偵測和追蹤機場或社區廢水中的病原來判斷疫情蔓延的程度和區域，並與政府單位合作推動進一步的防疫規劃。這次的講座兩位專家將從技術、經濟、法規和公衛等各面向切入來探討生物安全對我們生活的影響以及其他將病原偵測引入現實生活的案例。這將會是一場跨足學術、業界與政府單位合作的知識饗宴，不可錯過的難得機會，趕快報名！

Did you know that the initial awareness of COVID-19 and immediate action for prevention in Taiwan is in part attributed to a post on an online forum?

🏥Back in 2019, a physician in Taiwan noticed a trending post on an internet forum discussing an outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan. The physician informed the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Taiwan CDC swiftly implemented the prevention strategies from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following rapid technological advancements such as antigen testing, vaccines, and medications, the focus of SARS-CoV-2 research around the globe has shifted to pathogen surveillance over the past four years. As we enter the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, countries around the world are actively developing pathogen surveillance programs to ensure early control and prevention of disease transmission through systematic monitoring and screening of pathogens.

🫁Join us as we delve into this transformative journey with Robert Morfino, Senior Director at Ginkgo Bioworks, and Dr. Shu-Yu Hsu. Discover how Morfino and Dr. Hsu monitored pathogens like COVID-19 in major US airports and community wastewater. The insights from their programs have enabled government agencies to take immediate action.  In this seminar, they will unravel the mysteries of biosecurity and pathogen surveillance, exploring the intersection of technology, economy, policy, and public health.
Don't miss this opportunity to gain invaluable academic insights and industrial perspectives. Secure your spot today and be part of shaping the future of global biosecurity!

#### Shu-Yu Hsu, PhD

Scientist, Verve Therapeutics

ShuYu has completed her PhD at University of Missouri under the supervision of Prof. Chung-Ho Lin. Her research focused on bacterial bioremediation of atrazine.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Hsu has leveraged her expertise in environmental science and volunteered in the wastewater surveillance program, a collaborative project by the Missouri State Government, School of Natural Resources, and School of Medicine, University of Missouri, to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. She has pioneered the use of caffeine as a marker to estimate COVID-19 infection rate. The program has been expanded to detect a wide portfolio of pathogens and chemical markers.
