妳/你是否也有著創立事業實現夢想或是加入創業團隊的想法，卻不知道從何開始呢？

BTBA很榮幸邀請到兩位身兼教授與執行長雙重身分的公司創辦人來分享他們的經驗，包括創業的動機，創業過程中遇到的挑戰與收穫，以及營運公司時的心路歷程。若是妳/你好奇在台灣如何將學界研究轉化成創業資源，又或是未來計畫回台創業想多了解台灣創業環境，我們邀請到了最優秀的講者，準備了最精彩的故事，分享給相信「給我一個支點以及一根足夠長的槓桿，我將舉起地球。」的每一個妳/你。(此活動以中文進行)

BTBA is thrilled to invite two distinguished individuals who wear the hats of both professors and CEOs, each having founded their own companies. They will be sharing their wealth of experiences, delving into the motivations behind their entrepreneurial journeys, the challenges faced, the rewards reaped, and the personal evolution entailed in operating a company. Whether you're intrigued by the transformation of academic research into entrepreneurial resources in Taiwan or contemplating a return to Taiwan for entrepreneurial pursuits in the future, please join us at this event, which will be held in Mandarin Chinese.
