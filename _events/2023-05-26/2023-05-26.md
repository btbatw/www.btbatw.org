今年去日本旅遊了嗎？懷念漫步在京都花見小路上的悠閒時光嗎？還是想再次穿過雷門踏上仲見世通造訪淺草寺？總是被朋友日本旅遊照片包圍的你/妳，會好奇在日本從事學術工作的生活是怎麼樣的嗎？

BTBA很榮幸邀請到四位分別在日本東京大學、東北大學、九州大學、早稻田大學的台灣學者，向大家分享日本任教的經驗，包含學術環境、日常生活、及沒有日本學位如何申請日本學術工作等。若是你/妳想多了解一些台灣以外的亞洲國家的學術環境，又或者你/妳被日本文化美景吸引想移居日本，歡迎來參加這次的活動。5/26晚上九點(台灣5/27早上九點，日本早上十點)準時開講！(此活動以中文進行)

- 💡 主題 / Topic: Academic Career in Japan

As a biomedical scientist, you may have been inspired by the genetic mechanisms that produce antibody diversity that are described in Susumu Tonegawa’s beautiful work. You may also have used Shinya Yamanaka’s “Yamanaka factors” to generate iPS cells. Japan is one of the global leaders in many scientific fields, such as robotics, natural sciences, and biomedical research. Have you ever wondered what an academic career in Japan is like?

BTBA is honored to invite four Taiwanese faculty working currently at top research universities in Japan, including the University of Tokyo, Tohoku University, Kyushu University, and Waseda University, to share their experiences. The topics will include the academic environment, daily faculty life, Japan’s university system, and how to apply for academic positions in Japan without a degree from Japan. If you want to learn more about the academic environment in other Asian countries besides Taiwan, or are attracted by the beauty of Japanese culture and scenery and are considering moving to Japan, please join us at this event, which will be held in Mandarin Chinese.

講者(Panelists)：

**Hsin-Ni Ho (何昕霓), Ph.D.**<br>
Dr. Ho is an associate professor in the Faculty of Design at Kyushu University in Japan. She received a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in 2006. After earning a Ph.D., she worked as a research scientist in the NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Japan from 2007 to 2021. Her lab focuses on modeling physical processes during hand-object interactions for the development of haptic interfaces and aims to understand how the brain processes cutaneous inputs and integrates them with other sensory inputs to form a unified perception of touch events.<br>

**Shao-Min (Sean) Hung (洪紹閔), Ph.D.**<br>
Dr. Hung is an assistant professor at the Waseda Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan. He received a BS in Psychology at National Taiwan University and a Ph.D. at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. After his postdoctoral training at Caltech in the US, Dr. Hung moved to Japan and began his professorship there in 2022. He is interested in understanding the way the brain processes information not captured by our consciousness and how such information prompts behaviors. His lab uses psychophysics, eye tracking, EEG, fMRI, and other methods to address these questions.<br>

**Chia-Huei Tseng (曾加蕙), Ph.D.**<br>
Dr. Tseng is an associate professor at the Research Institute of Electrical Communication at Tohoku University in Japan. She finished her undergraduate degrees (BS in psychology and BM in international business management) from National Taiwan University (NTU) and a Ph.D. in Psychology from University of California, Irvine, USA. After her postdoctoral training at Rutgers University, Dr. Tseng started her professorship in several Asian countries. Before joining Tohoku University in 2016, she worked at NCKU, NTU and the University of Hong Kong. Her current research uses psychophysical, neurophysiological, and computational approaches to answer how sensory systems construct the coherent world we experience.

**Chien-Te Wu (吳建德), Ph.D.**<br>
Dr. Wu is a project associate professor at the International Research Center for Neurointelligence at the University of Tokyo. He received a BS in occupational therapy at NTU in Taiwan and a Ph.D. in Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University in the US. After earning a Ph.D., Dr. Wu moved to France for his postdoctoral training at the Université Paul Sabatiér. He worked in the School of Occupational Therapy at NTU as an assistant and associate professor from 2010 to 2021. His expertise includes attention and visual awareness, social decision-making behaviors, and EEG-based brain-computer interfaces.

策劃與主持人(Organizer & Moderator)：

**Wei-Chao Huang (黃威超), Ph.D.**<br>
Wei-Chao is a postdoctoral associate at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He earned a B.S. in Occupational Therapy at NTU, an M.S. in Neuroscience at NYMU in Taiwan, and a Ph.D. in Neurobiology at the University of Utah in the US. During his Ph.D. studies, he worked on several projects to determine allele-specific expression effects and their epigenetic mechanisms in the brain through next-generation sequencing. In 2019, Wei-Chao moved to Boston to take a position at Amgen. At Broad, he is focused now on studying the mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders using mouse models.<br>
