🏥隨著當今各種新藥百花齊放，醫療器材的創新進展也是醫療產業中不可忽視的一塊。從更精準快速的診斷分析，到各種影像技術，或是日新月異的醫材器械都提供了醫師以及病人更多元的治療手段。

🏥不過到底什麼才算是醫療器材？ 醫療器材的開發與規範跟新藥研發有哪些相似之處？BTBA一月月會邀請了在醫療器材產業界有多年經驗的Dr. John Perng以及Dr. Philip Chiu。他們將解答大家的各種疑問，以及洞悉醫療器材產業的動向與未來發展。

🚑Amid the rapid growth of new drugs today, innovation in medical devices is also an indispensable aspect of the healthcare industry. With more precise and expedited diagnostic analyses, various imaging technologies, and the continually advancing landscape of medical devices and equipment, nowadays, physicians and patients can benefit from more diverse treatment options.

🚑However, what defines a medical device? How does its development and regulation compare to the research and development of new pharmaceuticals?

🚑In the upcoming January BTBA panel discussion, we are pleased to invite Dr. John Perng and Dr. Philip Chiu, both with extensive experience in the medical device industry. They will address various questions about medical devices and provide insights into the trends and future developments of the medical device industry.
