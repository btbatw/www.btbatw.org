蛋白質之間的交互作用是許多生物功能例如識別抗原和免疫訊號傳遞的基礎。近年來，基於深度學習的蛋白質結構預測方法的突破和電腦蛋白設計的發展，設計有功能且穩定的蛋白質變得越來越唾手可得。你想深入了解如何應用這些基本原理，創造未來各式各樣的應用嗎？在本次研討會中，我們將與Professor Bruno Correia一起探討蛋白設計在免疫工程中的應用，並分享最新的方法和實際案例。會後我們將邀請Professor Correia跟Dr. Ching-Lin Hsieh和我們討論目前蛋白工程在免疫應用上的進展與挑戰

Protein-protein interaction plays a vital role in numerous biological functions such as immune signaling and antigen recognition. An understanding of the fundamental principles of protein-protein interactions has the potential for broad applications. Recently, the emergence of deep-learning-based protein structure prediction methods has created new opportunities for investigating protein-protein interactions at the structural level. Additionally, computational protein design has made significant strides in engineering de novo proteins that bind specifically to protein targets and perform desired functions. During the seminar, Professor Bruno Correia will present the latest advancements in the use of protein design for immunoengineering. The seminar will focus on the development of innovative approaches and concrete examples. Following the talk, Dr. Ching-Lin Hsieh will join Professor Correia in a discussion with the audience about the current achievements, challenges, and future work of protein engineering in immunology.
