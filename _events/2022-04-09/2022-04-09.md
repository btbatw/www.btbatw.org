        - Dr. Tsai spent her undergraduate years studying biology and exploring the mountains of her native Taiwan before reading for her Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, UK. She then moved from rainy Britain to sunny California to further study non-coding RNAs at Stanford University. She is interested in all aspects of biology and especially technological innovations that allow for new understanding of fundamental biology and its potential application. Having experienced its power to inspire, she is an ardent proponent of science and strives to help authors convey their discoveries to the largest possible audience for maximal impact within the scientific community and society at large.
- Moderator: 吳怡蕙 博士 | 哈佛醫學院 / 波士頓兒童醫院博士後研究員

She is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School/Boston’s Children’s Hospital studying RNA sensing in innate immunity.
