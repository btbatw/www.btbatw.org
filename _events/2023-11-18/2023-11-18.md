🫸🏻 在Welcome Party之後，本屆BTBA的第一個實體月會即將到來！🫷

本次月會為Data-Driven Decision Making in Biotech/Healthcare的職涯分享。在數據滿街的世界，如何有效蒐集、整合、分析以及利用龐大資料至關重要。生技相關產業中，除了利用機器學習/AI加速藥物開發之外，其他部門對於應用數據以及數位工具來做方案決策也越加重視。

我們邀請Paul Lo, Georgia Lin, 以及Chun Liu分享他們在Biotech/Healthcare業界的工作經歷，內容跨足大藥廠的portfolio策略 、臨床試驗中數位工具的應用，以及藥局行銷活動的效度評估等。無論您是正擁有轉換跑道的念頭，或是想在目前的職位上探索新的斜槓人生，相信本次的月會討論能夠讓大家更加了解生技產業中的不同面向！(P.S. 本活動全程以中文進行; In-person only)
