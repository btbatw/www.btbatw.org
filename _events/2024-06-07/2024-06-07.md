### Speakers

#### Dr. Tess Lu 呂采修

Director (Research), Ochre Bio, Taiwan

Trained as a scientist in epigenetics and metabolic diseases, Tess made her transition to the industry as a STAR Post-doctoral fellow at Novo Nordisk working on GLP-1's regulation on appetite. She continued her career at Novo Nordisk as a scientist and senior scientist at the Stem Cell Department, setting up the first single-cell platform in the company. After her maternity break, she made the transition back to Taiwan and started the Taipei chapter as Research Director for Ochre Bio, a liver RNA-therapeutics company headquartered in Oxford UK.

### Moderator

#### Dr. Chih-Hsiang Yang 楊志祥

Postdoctoral Associate at UMass Chan Medical School

Dr. Yang is a passionate scientist with expertise in rodent models, epigenetics, obesity/diabetes, and metabolism. He’s especially fascinated by the paternal intergenerational effect when encountering environmental factors. He worked at the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics and received his Ph.D. from the University of Freiburg, Germany. In his Ph.D. work, he focused on the role of Neuronatin (Nnat) in buffering metabolic variation as an outcome of overgrowth/obesity encountering unknown environmental factors. He observed a bi-stable body composition phenotype in the Nnat deficient mouse model and further explored the causal mechanism mediated by HDAC-related gene profile via genomic approaches. The key concept from the story is to reshape people’s views on obesity subtypes in mammals from mice to human beings. As a postdoctoral fellow, he joined Rando's laboratory at UMass Chan Medical School, studying paternal epigenetic inheritance effect on offspring when parents are exposed to the high-fat diet or paternal aging.
