🎤 相信在美國讀書或工作的你一定會有過以下經驗吧？
- 參加大型會議時需要當會議主持人，引言或者控制會議節奏
- Seminar邀請講者時，擔任panel discussion的主持人與講者互相丟接球談話
- 主辦會議時需要設計panel discussion的訪綱等等......

🎤 哪怕我們用母語中文做這些事時都略顯困難且缺乏公眾發言的信心，那麼身為非英文母語人士的我們又該如何增加「主持功力」這項技能，讓我們可以自信的在光開場合發言，訪問講者，做出轉折與結語，甚至聽懂來自各地觀眾的發問並進一步總結提問呢？除了自身已堅強的科學背景，相信這項主持技能會增加自己更被看見的機會唷！歡迎大家來工作坊磨練一番吧！

🎤 Hello everyone! We are excited to invite you to the LEAP Workshop hosted by the Boston Taiwanese Biotech Association (BTBA) on June 9 from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm!

🎤 As professionals in the U.S., you must have many opportunities to moderate conferences, meetings, or symposia. We've heard you! Moderation is not easy, especially for those who are not native English speakers. We hope this workshop can boost your confidence in public speaking and leading panel discussions.

🎤 Through practicing in this workshop, you'll learn basic moderation skills, listening and rephrasing audience questions and panelists' comments, and politely interrupting when time is tight, among other things. There will be plenty of hands-on practice during the workshop, and pre-work is required. If you're ready to gain this soft skill, don't hesitate to sign up!!!!

🎤 Please find the speaker's short bio in the comments below!
